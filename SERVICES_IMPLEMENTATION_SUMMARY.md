# Services Module Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully rebuilt the Services frontend module for the Agricultural Coordinator Dashboard, following the Program module's structure and properly connecting to the existing Laravel backend API.

## What Was Done

### 1. Backend Analysis ✅
Analyzed the existing Laravel backend:
- **Models**: ServiceCatalog, ServiceEvent, ServiceBeneficiary, ServiceEventStock
- **Controllers**: 4 API controllers for complete CRUD operations
- **Endpoints**: RESTful API routes at `/api/service-catalogs` and `/api/service-events`
- **Relationships**: Proper Eloquent relationships with beneficiaries, inventory, and coordinators

### 2. Frontend Cleanup ✅
Removed broken/incomplete files:
- `ServiceEventList.js` (missing imports, broken references)
- `ServiceBeneficiaries.js` (missing imports)
- `ServiceEventStocks.js` (placeholder only)
- `ServiceCatalogManagement.js` (to be rebuilt properly)
